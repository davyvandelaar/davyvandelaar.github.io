      <description>In June 2017 I&amp;rsquo;ve visited Scotland with my best friend for two weeks. We drove a lot through the beautiful countryside and saw a lot of different animals: cattle, deer, birds, dolphins, and sheep. Sheep everywhere!
At one beautiful camping site, we saw cattle in fog in the very early morning and took a picture of it. The image now has the title &amp;ldquo;Rindviecher im Nebel&amp;rdquo;, a quite funny German phrase that means cattle in the fog.</description>
